## what are the use cases for the linux strip(1) command?

The strip command in Linux is used to remove debugging symbols and other
metadata from an executable file. This reduces the file size and helps to
protect intellectual property by making it harder for others to reverse
engineer the executable.

Some common use cases for the strip command include:

* Reducing file size: By removing the debugging symbols and other metadata
from an executable, the file size can be reduced significantly. This can be
useful for embedded systems or other environments where storage space is
limited.

* Enhancing security: By removing the debugging symbols, it becomes more
difficult for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in the executable.

* Reducing memory usage: Removing the debugging symbols can also reduce the
memory usage of the executable when it is loaded into memory.

* Optimizing performance: The strip command can be used in conjunction with
other tools to optimize the performance of an executable by removing
unnecessary code or data.

Overall, the strip command is a useful tool for optimizing and securing Linux
executables.

I have the following objdump output:

    $ objdump -t main.o

    main.o:     file format elf64-x86-64

    SYMBOL TABLE:
    0000000000000000 l    df *ABS*  0000000000000000 main.c
    0000000000000000 l    d  .text  0000000000000000 .text
    0000000000000000 l    d  .rodata    0000000000000000 .rodata
    0000000000000000 g     F .text  000000000000002e print_name
    0000000000000000         *UND*  0000000000000000 printf

can you explain the various fiels and their meaning?

Certainly! Here is a breakdown of the output of objdump -t main.o:

* main.o: This is the name of the object file being inspected.
* file format elf64-x86-64: This line tells us the format of the object file.
In this case, it is in the ELF format for a 64-bit x86 architecture.
* SYMBOL TABLE:: This indicates that the following lines show the symbol
table of the object file.
* 0000000000000000 l df *ABS* 0000000000000000 main.c: This is the first entry
  in the symbol table. It represents the symbol for the file itself. The fields are:

    * 0000000000000000: The address or value of the symbol. For the file
symbol, this is always zero.
    * l: The symbol binding. In this case, it is "local" because it is only
accessible within this object file.
    * df: The symbol type. In this case, it means that this is a file symbol.
    * *ABS*: The section to which the symbol is associated. In this case, it
is an absolute symbol, meaning that it has no associated section.
    * 0000000000000000: The size of the symbol. For the file symbol, this is
always zero.

* main.c: The name of the symbol.
* 0000000000000000 l d .text 0000000000000000 .text: This is the second entry
in the symbol table. It represents the symbol for the .text section. The fields
are:

    * 0000000000000000: The address or value of the symbol. For a section
symbol, this is always zero.
    * l: The symbol binding. In this case, it is "local" because it is only
accessible within this object file.
    * d: The symbol type. In this case, it means that this is a section
symbol.
    `.text`: The section to which the symbol is associated. In this case, it
is the .text section.
    * 0000000000000000: The size of the symbol. For a section symbol, this is
always zero.
    `.text`: The name of the symbol.

    0000000000000000 l d .rodata 0000000000000000 .rodata: This is the third
entry in the symbol table. It represents the symbol for the .rodata section.
The fields are similar to the previous entry.

    0000000000000000 g F .text 000000000000002e print_name: This is the fourth
entry in the symbol table. It represents the symbol for the function
print_name(). The fields are:

        0000000000000000: The address or value of the symbol. In this case, it
is the address of the function.

        g: The symbol binding. In this case, it is "global" because it can be
accessed by other object files.

        F: The symbol type. In this case, it means that this is a function
symbol.

        .text: The section to which the symbol is associated. In this case, it
is the .text section.

        000000000000002e: The size of the symbol. For a function symbol, this
is the size of the function in bytes.

        print_name: The name of the symbol.
